      <description>I want to build NESRM using something other than javascript as the router. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the file systme router in NextJS and I need speeds closer to Golang or Rust. BUT I see very poor resources in using react as it was meant to be used: a FE framework for an MPA with some other backend
I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to get some experience with this using this tutorial on how to build a chat appliation using go and reactJS.</description>

      <description>This theme auto generates pages and subpages and directories to handle the menu items for tags and categories. I tried used categories and changing the front end to be projets, but the auto generation keeps overwrting what I do. This is annoying. How do I make the autogeneration conform to my new projets folder or stop this overwrite god</description>

      <description>Well I don&amp;rsquo;t remember where the old project was hosted, but let&amp;rsquo;s figure out where to host this one, and hopefully get some CI going so keeping this up-to-date isn&amp;rsquo;t a pain.
Github I got this git repo pushed to github.com/sai-sy/devlog so we&amp;rsquo;re good to go
Cloudflare I got a Cloudflare page up, now I need to make sure the CI is working. I think we have lift off for the devlog though</description>

      <description>This is a third attempt at making a blog I&amp;rsquo;m happy with and keep up with. Currently there&amp;rsquo;s too much learning too do, too many tests, too many contracts, too many categories. I can&amp;rsquo;t keep up. Is this what eery developer deals with. Maybe just anyone and everyone. Or maybe I&amp;rsquo;m not cut out for the lifestyle I claim to partake in. Either way I need some way to jot things down.</description>
