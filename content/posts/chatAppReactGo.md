I want to build NESRM using something other than javascript as the router. I don't like the file systme router in NextJS and I need speeds closer to Golang or Rust. BUT I see very poor resources in using react as it was meant to be used: a FE framework for an MPA with some other backend

I'm going to try to get some experience with this using [this](https://tutorialedge.net/projects/chat-system-in-go-and-react/) tutorial on how to build a chat appliation using go and reactJS. Hopefully it'll provide some insight
