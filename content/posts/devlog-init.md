This is a third attempt at making a blog I'm happy with and keep up with. Currently there's too much learning too do, too many tests, too many contracts, too many categories. I can't keep up. Is this what eery developer deals with. Maybe just anyone and everyone. Or maybe I'm not cut out for the lifestyle I claim to partake in. Either way I need some way to jot things down. To express ideas.
