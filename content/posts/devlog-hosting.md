Well I don't remember where the old project was hosted, but let's figure out where to host this one, and hopefully get some CI going so keeping this up-to-date isn't a pain.

1. Github
I got this git repo pushed to github.com/sai-sy/devlog so we're good to go 

2. Cloudflare
I got a Cloudflare page up, now I need to make sure the CI is working. I think we have lift off for the devlog though
