This theme auto generates pages and subpages and directories to handle the menu items for tags and categories. I tried used categories and changing the front end to be projets, but the auto generation keeps overwrting what I do. This is annoying. How do I make the autogeneration conform to my new projets folder or stop this overwrite god
